* The main purpose of the project was to build a smart Chatbot model that would be able to serve customers in a clothes shop or even an online store without any human-to-human interaction.

* The first task which has to be done by the Chatbot is to understand the user’s input sentences and that can be done by analyzing the sentences using Natural Language Processing tools and then extracting the important features.

* The next task is the decision making and then answering the user which can be done through a trained model and some databases where the Bot can find the most suitable answer for this situation.

* In addition, The Bot has to manage the databases to update the data of the available stocks, store the details of the orders, and save every new input to be able to develop the model later.
